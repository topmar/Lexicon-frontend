        <p class="crawl-text">
            It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,
            striking from a hidden base, have won their
            first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

        <p class="crawl-text">
            During the battle, Rebel spies managed to
            steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate
            weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored
            space station with enough power to destroy
            an entire planet.

            Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
            Princess Leia races home aboard her
            starship, custodian of the stolen plans that
            can save her people and restore freedom to
            the galaxy....
